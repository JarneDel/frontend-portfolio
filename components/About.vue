      </h2>
      <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        Hi there! I'm a full-stack web developer and Linux enthusiast with a
        passion for building beautiful and functional websites. As a student,
        I'm constantly learning and expanding my skillset to stay on top of the
        latest trends and technologies.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        With my strong technical skills and attention to detail, I strive to
        create seamless user experiences that bring ideas to life. When I'm not
        coding away at my computer or studying for exams, you can find me
        tinkering with Linux and exploring new technologies.
