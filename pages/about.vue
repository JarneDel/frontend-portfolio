      My road to becoming a developer
    </h2>
    <h3 class="mt-6 text-2xl font-medium">The very beginning</h3>
    <p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">
      In high school, I studied Industrial Sciences. I learned a lot about
      electricity, mechanics, and electronics. But in 5th year, I decided to
      move to Electrical Engineering where i got in contact with programming. I
      started learning with arduino, and was fascinated by being able to turn on
      a led with a few lines of code. Instantly i knew that this was the
      beginning of my journey.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-medium">Chapter 2</h3>
    <p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">
      After graduating high school, I decided to study Multimedia and Creative
      Technologies at the Hogeschool West-Vlaanderen. Here I learned how to code
      the <span class="italic">right</span> way. In my first year, I learned the
      basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, along with user experience and
      interface design. This built a solid foundation for the next years. Then
      came the end of the second semester, where we had to combine all of our
      knowledge into a project, this way <strong>Project One</strong> was born.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-medium">Making Choices, Again...</h3>
    <p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">
      In the third semester, after learning some more advanced code, we learnt
      basic app development in Xamarin forms. I had my first touch with cloud
      infrastructure and Interaction design where I was able to put my knowledge
      to the test and made League of Statistics. <br />
      After which I had the pleasure to work in team on Jumping Jaws, where our
      team decided to learn something on our own, a Unity Game with a nodejs
      backed, which turned out great.
      <br />
      But then came the end of the semester, and I had to make a choice. I had
      to choose between Ai, XR (VR/AR), and Web. I decided to go for web,
      because I made League of Statistics without any Javascript frameworks and
      was eager to find out what is capable with them.
    </p>
    <h3 class="mt-2 text-2xl font-medium">The present</h3>
    <p class="mt-4 text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-300">
      Now I'm in at the end of my second year, getting ready for my first
      contact with the industry project, where I will be working in a team of 4
      to make a project for Delaware.
